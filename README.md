The list of techniques to break up with your phone
- Create speed bumps - Put a rubber band around your phone as a physical reminder to pause, or set a lock screen image that asks you to confirm that you really want to proceed.
- Pay attention to your body - What’s your posture like? How’s your breathing? Is whatever you’re doing on your phone making you feel good? Do you want to be using it right now?
- Practice phone seperation - Leave your phone at home while going for a walk or going to the store. Increase the challenges as you go.
- Use technology to protect yourself from technology - Apps like Moment or Quality Time are good ones to start. 
- Use the sight of other people on their phones as a reminder of your own intentions
- Turn your phones color off and go into greyscale mode
- Get existential about it - If all else fails, consider your own mortality. How many people on their deathbeds do you think are going to say, “I wish I’d spent more time on Facebook”?
- Delete all social media apps
- Turn off all notifications
- Delete email from your phone
- Buy a dumbphone and use it on the weekends
