The list of techniques to break up with your phone
- Create speed bumps - Put a rubber band around your phone as a physical reminder to pause, or set a lock screen image that asks you to confirm that you really want to proceed.
- Pay attention to your body - What’s your posture like? How’s your breathing? Is whatever you’re doing on your phone making you feel good? Do you want to be using it right now?
- Practice phone seperation - Leave your phone at home while going for a walk or going to the store. Increase the challenges as you go.
- Use technology to protect yourself from technology - Apps like Moment or Quality Time are good ones to start. 
- Use the sight of other people on their phones as a reminder of your own intentions
- Turn your phones color off and go into greyscale mode
- Get existential about it - If all else fails, consider your own mortality. How many people on their deathbeds do you think are going to say, “I wish I’d spent more time on Facebook”?
- Delete all social media apps
- Turn off all notifications
- Delete email from your phone
- Buy a dumbphone and use it on the weekends
- Heel/toe click... when walking up or down stairs do the heel/toe technique in order to safely walk up and down the stairs while texting without falling
- Depersonalize your phone (remove cute stickers, screensavers, quotes, etc) so you are not so closely tied to it.
- Rubberband reminder around your smartphone
- Screensaver reminder to use your phone less
- Delete all social media apps from your phone and only use them on your laptop
- Use a password manager to keep all your passwords and never have to worry about deleting apps because they are addicting ever again
- Find or buy a standalone alarm clock instead of using your smartphone alarm clock
- Catherine Price does this "I have a bed for my phone. Like, with sheets and everything. (And charging cables.)  Every evening after dinner, I tuck in my phone, and I don’t look at again till after my first cup of coffee in the morning."
- Make your own phone "sleeping bad" or ziplock bag or smartphone locker
- Set auto-text responses for all your text messages
- Add offline triggers to your life... put a book around your bed instead of your phone, etc
- No phone zone signs for restaraunts 
- No phone zone for bathrooms
